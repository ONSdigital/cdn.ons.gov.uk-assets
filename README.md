cdn.ons.gov.uk assets
=====================

Static assets for ONS web services.

### Using assets

The `assets` directory in this repository is published to the CDN
under an equivalent `assets` directory.

For example, to include the ONS logo (from [assets/images/ons-logo.png](assets/images/ons-logo.png)), you would
link to the file using the following URL:

```
https://cdn.ons.gov.uk/assets/images/ons-logo.png
```

### Adding assets

To add new assets to the CDN, add them to a new branch and
submit a pull request on GitHub.

The pull request will be reviewed by the ONS Website team.

Once the pull request has been merged, assets will be published
to the ONS CDN.

### Removing assets

To remove assets, remove them in a branch and submit a
pull request on GitHub.

Please include the reason for removal.

We would not normally expect to remove assets since
it would be difficult to be certain they are no longer in use.
